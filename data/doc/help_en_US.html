           Getting Started 
        </h1>
        <p>
           Welcome! 
          <br>
          <br>
           Getting started using OpenCPN consists of 3 basic steps: 
        </p>

               &nbsp;It is important to know the location of the log file and the configuration file on your computer. If you ask questions on the forum, there is a fair chance that you will be asked about the content in these files. Once you get familiar with OpenCPN, have a look at the files! 
            </li>
            <li>
               On <strong>Linux</strong> the "opencpn.log" is in your home directory. 
              <br>
               The "opencpn.conf" is in a hidden directory, called "opencpn", also in your home directory. 
              <br>
               For a quick way to view the files you can try these commands. 
              <br>
               $gedit `echo $HOME/opencpn.log` 
              <br>
               $gedit `echo $HOME/.opencpn/opencpn.conf` 
              <br>
               Of course you can swap "gedit" for your favourite editor. 
            </li>
            <li>
               On <strong>Windows 2000, XP and Vista and Windows 7 </strong>the two files, opencpn.log and opencpn.ini are in a location governed by the environmental variable %APPDATA%. 
              <br>
               From any command prompt enter: explorer %APPDATA%\opencpn. Windows Explorer will start with the correct folder open. 
            </li>
            <li>
               As an alternative follow these instructions: 
              <br>
               1 Go to Start -&gt; Run 
              <br>
               2 Enter Code: %APPDATA%\opencpn 
              <br>
               3 Click OK! 
            </li>
            <li>
               On Windows 7, instead of "Run" use &nbsp; "Search programs and files". 
            </li>
            <li>
               Note that some folders in the path %APPDATA% are hidden, so to be able to navigate to the log- and ini-file you may have to adjust your settings.

             Installing Charts 
          </h1>
           To install charts OpenCPN must be pointed to a directory containing charts of a <a href="http://opencpn.org/chart_formats">recognized format</a>. Don't point OpenCPN to individual charts, you must specify the directory that contains the charts. Download some charts (see below) and organize them in a fashion that suits you.&nbsp; You may want to consider storing them in a directory where they will not be tampered with or moved accidentally. 
          <br>
           Open the Toolbox by clicking <img alt="" src="images/settings.png" height="32" width="32">.&nbsp; You are sent to the first tab "Settings", tick the box "Show Chart Outlines", this will help you visualize the loaded charts. 
          <br>
           &nbsp; 
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="images/wx3.png" height="297" width="642">
          <br>
          <br>
           Then click the tab "Charts". 
          <br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="images/wx4.png" height="670" width="653">
          <br>
          <br>
           Under "Available Chart Directories" navigate to your chart-directory. Above we have found the South China Sea vector charts in the /opt/Navigation/ENC directory. When clicking the button "Add Selection" the selected chart directory appears in the box "Active Chart Directories". The screen-shots are from Linux, but this process works similar on all platforms. All that remains is to click the "Ok" button. OpenCPN will then process your selection. You can now start using your charts. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Start using your charts</strong>. 
          <br>
           You can click and drag the chart with your mouse. The scroll wheel zooms in and out. Right clicking brings up a menu with useful actions. Exactly what the menu contains depends on the circumstances. Read the rest of the manual for a full explanation. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>A few hints. </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               If all is just black, with maybe some blue lines, you are viewing the background world vector shoreline chart. You must move to the geographical position of the charts you just loaded. As you come close you will see the outlines of your loaded charts, in red for raster charts and in green for S57 vector charts. Click in the rectangle created by the outlines, to activate, and view the chart. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <a name="cm93"></a>As you ticked the, Show Outline box, as described above, the loaded charts will be outlined in red for raster and green for vector charts. In CM93 the charts will be outlined in purple. The smallest scale charts in CM93, the Z scale and A scale charts will not be outlined, neither will all available charts be visible as outlines at the same time. The reason for this is computing speed and clarity. Generally the next level or two of larger scale charts are shown. Presently this presents a problem in a few areas, where no B scale charts are available, and large scale plans exists, directly embedded in the small scale charts. Generally in areas where only A or Z scale charts are available, expect potentially dangerous omissions. <strong>Warning</strong>, do not use CM93 small scale charts only, for navigation, without referring to other sources. 
            </li>
            <li>
               When using a vector chart for the first time OpenCPN has to process the data, and transform the information to an internal display format. This can take some time, depending on your computer. This internal SENC chart is then saved for future use. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Be aware that it is possible to "Over-zoom" charts in OpenCPN. A warning will appear on the display. Please respect this warning. It is recommended to not zoom more than a factor 2, for safe navigation. You will find the actual zoom-factor in the lower right-hand corner of the display. 
            </li>
            <li>
               It is safe and reasonably efficient to put all your charts <strong>except&nbsp; </strong>the CM93 database in one large directory, and set that directory in Toolbox-&gt;Charts. The CM93 database contains its own file and directory structure. The top-level directory only, of this database should be loaded, as described above, into OpenCPN. 
              <br>
               If you do a lot of chart downloads, updates, etc., then it will be faster to break the charts folder into smaller groups, and specify them individually in the Toolbox-&gt;Charts dialog. 
            </li>
            <li>
               The option "Force Full Database Rebuild" is mainly aimed at users converting charts, in a situation where minor changes or corrections are made. 
            </li>
            <li>
               OpenCPN,&nbsp; supports&nbsp; <strong>Mercator charts, Transverse Mercator Charts and Polyconical Charts</strong> (US Great Lakes). Charts using other projections will be displayed as if the were Mercator charts, except for the fact that they will not be used for quilting. Most charts are using Mercator projection, so this limitation is not to bad. 
              <br>
               Other projections, such as <strong>Gnomonic</strong>, are mainly used in larger scale charts, for smaller areas, for example harbor plans, in scales larger than 1:50,000. 
              <br>
               The errors introduced in OpenCPN by treating these charts as Mercator are generally small, but <strong>be aware of this limitation</strong>.

               Chart Formats 
            </h1>
            <h3>
               OpenCPN supported chart formats: 
            </h3>
            <p>
              <strong>BSB / RNC / KAP Versions 1, 2 and 3. </strong>
              <br>
               (BSB Version 4 and later are not supported due to proprietary encryption algorithms.) 
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>NOS/GEO Version 1</strong> Subsequent versions are probably supported but need to be tested. However, this format is obsolete for new charts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CM93 Version 2.</strong>
              <br>
               (C-map Version 3 and later are not supported.) 
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>S57/S52 (ENC).</strong>
              <br>
               (S63 Encrypted ENC is not supported. This is the format for the majority of newly produced vector charts from many national hydrographic offices. S63 charts are exactly the same as S57 except the they are encrypted to keep them from being illegally distributed.) 
            </p>
            <h3>
               Other formats, that with some effort, can be used. 
            </h3>
            <p>
               Generally many chart pictures in <strong>gif, jpeg, png, tif </strong>and other formats can be used, when properly geo-referenced, to generate<strong> KAP</strong> file (BSB / RNC) that OpenCPN can display. For the details about this process see the <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/charts-31346.html">chart thread</a> in the forum.&nbsp; Also, make sure to browse around the forum as there are a handfull of other interesting chart related threads. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>WCI</strong> charts generated with <a href="http://www.sping.com/seaclear/">SeaClear and MapCal </a>can also be transformed to BSB charts and used by OpenCPN. The key is to open a WCI chart in MapCal and convert it to a BMP picture, and then transform this picture to a tiff file, using for example ImageMagic. 
            </p>
            <p>
               &nbsp;Before Maptech started to produce BSB charts the <strong>HDR</strong> format was used in the late eighties to mid nineties. These charts consists of many picture tiles in <strong>pcx </strong>format, more than 100 tiles is not unusual. The tiles can be merged to one picture and then used as any other picture to make an OpenCPN compatible chart. For details on this process see the<a href="http://opencpn.org/chart_conversion_manual"> Chart Conversion Manual</a>&nbsp; and <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/open-chart-standard-32731-4.html#post381315">this post</a> and the following posts in the forum. 
            </p>
            <p>
               &nbsp;The HDR format is from an era when computer-memory and processing power were less powerful than today, as a consequence these charts are not of the same quality as more modern charts. Furthermore, most of these charts are not using WGS84 as reference datum. These charts should not be the first choice, but can be useful if nothing else is available. 
            </p>
            <h3>
               Other formats that are <em>not</em> supported. 
            </h3>
            <p>
               The Hydrographic Chart Raster Format (HCRF), used by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Offices' ARCS (Admiralty Raster Chart Service), Australian Hydrographic Services' Seafarer products and the NZ<em>Mariner</em>, New Zealands Official charts, are not supported.&nbsp; This is also due to proprietary encryption algorithms and copyright issues. 
              <br>
              <br>
               Mapmedia's various chart formats are not supported, for the same reasons as for the other proprietary charts.

                  <cite>Realizing that official and high quality small scale ENCs conforming with the established IHO standard were not available for the SCS, the EAHC MSs decided to cooperate closely and resolve the situation so that mariners could use most up-to-date chart information for voyage planning and enhancing safety of navigation, rather than resorted to some commercially developed electronic products which were either prepared in proprietary formats, or containing unofficial data with very infrequent updating.<br>

             Setting Up GPS 
          </h1>
          <br>
          <h3>
             Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7 
          </h3>
          <br>
          <p>
             To use OpenCPN with a GPS, a GPS receiver is needed. 
          </p>
          <p>
             There are a variety of possible choices for a GPS receiver: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
               A computer, such as a Sony Vaio P has a built in GPS receiver 
            </li>
            <li>
               A NMEA Expander to amplify a nmea stream to multiple listeners 
            </li>
            <li>
               A handheld GPS receiver 
            </li>
            <li>
               A dedicated GPS receiver 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
             The remainder of this section describes using OpenCPN with a dedicated GPS receiver, however, the instructions for a dedicated receiver will be similar for any serial/USB connected NMEA data stream. 
          </p>
          <h4>
             A Dedicated GPS Receiver 
          </h4>
          <p>
             There are several companies making dedicated GPS receivers. The Supplementary Hardware section for GPS devices lists several manufacturers. 
          </p>
          <p>
             NMEA has traditionally been implemented as a serial protocol and therefore, even if a USB connection is used, there needs to be a USB to Serial Port conversion. The specific driver for the each GPS receiver will handle this conversion. 
          </p>

             Configuring BU-353 
          </h4>
          <p>
             &nbsp;It is not necessary to use the installation disk to setup the BU-353. Following the steps listed below will result in the latest driver being installed. 
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
               Download the latest driver from Prolific - <a href="http://www.prolific.com.tw/Eng/downloads.asp?ID=31" title="http://www.prolific.com.tw/Eng/downloads.asp?ID=31">http://www.prolific.com.tw/Eng/downloads.asp?ID=31</a>

          <h4>
             Troubleshooting 
          </h4>
          <p>
             There is a small LED located on the BU-353. If the LED is off there is no power being received. Check the connection. 
          </p>
          <p>
             If the LED is solid it indicates the BU-353 is searching for a GPS signal. Try moving the GPS receiver to a clear location. 
          </p>
          <p>
             If the LED is flashing it indicates the BU-353 has a position fix and is transmitting data. 
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
               Try viewing the NMEA data stream in OpenCPN. Choose ToolBox-&gt;GPS-&gt;click Show GPS/NMEA Data Stream Window 
            </li>
            <li>
               Alternatively, a diagnostic program is included on the installation CD called GPSInfo.exe. Launch this program to install the diagnostic utility. 
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
             If it appears that the NMEA data stream is being received, the most likely issue is that OpenCPN is not centered over your location. Click AutoFollow to center the map at your GPS location. 
          </p>
          <h4>
             Known Issues 
          </h4>
          <p>
             If you change the USB port for the GPS receiver Prolific will reassign the COM port number. This will require repeating steps 4-12 above. 
          </p>
          <p>
             On some computer / GPS receiver combinations when the computer resumes from Stand By the GPS receiver will no longer transmit its NMEA data stream. 
          </p>
          <p>
             A workaround for this issue is provided by using a COM port splitter such as XPort <a href="http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html" title="http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html">http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html</a>

                   Go to Toolbox--&gt;GPS and select "Network GPSD" as your "NMEA Data Source", unless you have a gpsd version in the 2.9.x series( Ubuntu 10.04&nbsp; and other new distros). In this case choose&nbsp; Toolbox--&gt;GPS --&gt; "NMEA Data Source" --&gt;"Network LIBGPS".&nbsp; Note that in this case you also have to use OpenCPN version greater than 2.1.0 Beta build 530.

                <li>
                   On Ubuntu 9.10 and later, that is realy all you have to do. When you plug in your gps this will trigger gpsd to start.

                 Bluetooth GPS Ubuntu. 
              </h4>
              <br>
               If you have a bluetooth GPS&nbsp; you will need to first configure it through the standard Ubuntu Bluetooth "set up new device " proceedure. 
              <br>
              <br>
               Once you have done that you will need to find what the address of the GPS is. To do that you run this command. 
              <br>
              <br>
               sudo hcitool scan 
              <br>
              <br>
               it will then start looking for the Bluetooth GPS and hopefully find your GPS. You should see something similar. 
              <br>
              <br>
               Scanning ... 
              <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;00:1C:88:10:D3:4D &nbsp;&nbsp; iBT-GPS 
              <br>
              <br>
               In this case i have a IBT-GPS at address &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:1C:88:10:D3:4D &nbsp; (Your GPS address will be different) 
              <br>
              <br>
               Next we have to bind the GPS address to a "virtual" device OpenCPN understands in this case rfcomm0 
              <br>
              <br>
               we do this with the following command. 
              <br>
              <br>
               sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 00:1C:88:10:D3:4D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note put your GPS address in this line 
              <br>
              <br>
               It is my understanding you do not have to run these commands each time your linux is restarted as it will remeber your GPS address. 
              <br>
              <br>
               Now all you need to do is go into OpenCPN Toolbox and select GPS 
              <br>
              <br>
               Now in the NMEA Data Source options select from the pulldown menu 
              <br>
              <br>
               /dev/rfcomm0 
              <br>
              <br>
               Thats it you should now have a Bluetooth GPS Connected.

             On the bottom is the Status Bar(s). Activated from 'Tool Box-Show Status Bar'.

             The top line, 'Chart Selection Bar', has the following description. 
          </p>
          <p>
             If a larger scale chart (large scale = greater detail in a smaller area) is available for the location of your mouse pointer, you will see more than one segmented bar. The segmented color bars in the Status Bar represent: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Blue for Raster

            <li>
               The current chart displays as a lighter shade of its color, or if quilting is active, the charts currently making up the quilt are displayd in lighter shade. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
             When you hover the mouse pointer over the bar, and not in quilting mode, a thumbnail of the chart will appear under the <a href="http://opencpn.org/scaling_charts">SCALE IN/OUT </a>icons and a chart information box will pop up just above the button. If quilting is on, instead of a thumbnail, the chart represented by the button will be highlighted in a transparent reddish color. By clicking on the appropriate bar, or using the appropriate <a href="http://opencpn.org/hot_keys">HOT KEYS</a>, you will switch to the chart shown in the thumbnail. This feature is especially useful if you wish to view an ENC or a Raster chart of the same area.

             The bottom line starting from the left, has the position of the GPS that feeds OpenCPN (your ship or boat). SOG, COG, Cursor (position), From Ownship and TrueScale are in other boxes. If the true scale is missing on the far right, the chart quilting feature is activated.

            <br>
             To illustrate a lot of this, here is a screen shot in quilting mode.

            <em>The screen is a quilt of two Polyconical charts. Hovering the mouse pointer over the left chart-button highlights the lager scale chart for Manitowoc. Two smaller scale charts that cover the area displayed on the screen are included in the quilt, but are invisible as they are covered by the larger scale charts. To view these charts, right-click anywhere on a chart in the quilt and select "Remove this chart from quilt", one of these charts will now be shown in the quilt.<br> The Brown right most button shows that CM93 version 2, charts are available for the area, but not currently displayed.<br> The information box shows relevant information about the chart. We can see that the chart is&nbsp; Polyconic, and because of this a warning is displayed for poor accuracy. The reason is, that although Polyconic charts are allowed to participate in quilting, the result is not totally free from errors, however small.</em>

             Anchor Watch 
          </h1>
          <h2>
             &nbsp; 
          </h2>
          <p>
             Anchor watch can be set on any mark that you have created with OpenCPN, as long as the boat is within 5 cables of this mark. This means that the Anchor watch items, on the right click menu, will only be visible if&nbsp; your boat is within 0.5 nautical miles of any mark.&nbsp; A maximum of two marks can have anchor watch set at the same time. 
          </p>
           This feature can be used in other situations than just anchoring, but keeping an eye on your anchor, and making sure it isn't dragging, is the main purpose. Below we are using the "Man Overboard" icon to mark the anchor, this is just an easy way, and not necessary for the anchor watch to work. 
          <br>
          <br>
           To learn how it works let's make a dry run to a nice trade wind anchorage. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <div class="rtecenter">
            <img alt="" src="images/anchor-watch.png" height="354" width="400">
          </div>
          <br>
           After circling around and exploring the bay, we know where we want to drop our anchor. 
          <br>
           At&nbsp; the chosen spot we drop the anchor, at the same time we click the man overboard icon on OpenCPN to mark the point. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <div class="rtecenter">
            <img alt="" src="images/anchor-watch1.png" height="361" width="401">
          </div>
          <br>
           The wind, ENE at 15 kts let us drift back until we are satisfied with our scope. A burst in reverse convinces us that the anchor is set, later confirmed by a leisurely snorkeling over the anchor. Time to sort out the anchor watch 
          <br>
          <br>
          <div class="rtecenter">
            <img alt="" src="images/anchor-watch2.png" height="581" width="343">
          </div>
          <br>
           Right click on the man over board mark, choose properties, this brings up the "Mark Properties" dialog. We have to change a few things here to make it worthwhile setting the anchor watch. "Mark Name" is changed from "MAN&nbsp;OVERBOARD" to the watch circle in meters. In our case we have changed this to 60. We have 40 m of chain out, our gps antennae on our 40 footer sits at the pushpit, some minor gps uncertainties and a few extra meters for our anchor to dig in, is our reasoning for this. We also change the mark icon to something better than the life-buoy. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <div class="rtecenter">
            <img alt="" src="images/anchor-watch3.png" height="364" width="400">
          </div>
          <br>
           We right click on the mark once again, and choose "Set Anchor Watch" from the menu. 
          <br>
           See picture above. The anchor watch is now active, and an alarm will be set off if the boat for some reason exits the circle. To deactivate the anchor watch, right click on the mark and select "Clear Anchor Watch". 
          <br>
          <br>
           To get protection from the wind and a bit of northerly swell, we have really anchored to close to the beach. To keep an eye on this potential danger we set another mark on the beach. 
          <br>

          </div>
          <br>
           This time we set the "Mark Name" to -100, this means that if the boat comes within 100 meters of this mark, the alarm is set off.

          <br>
           An hour later, after a heavy squall passed, the wind goes light and flukey. The boat drifts towards the beach and the anchor alarm sounds and comes up on our computer screen. 
          <br>
           The alarm sound is the same as the AIS warning sound and is set in the ToolBox under the AIS tab.

This ends in a dot, that represents where we will be in 6 minutes, or 1.3 nautical miles ahead. We are meeting a vessel, steaming in the opposite direction following the traffic separation. This target also has a line and a dot in-front of it representing course and where it will be in 6 minutes(user configurable). The two blue dots with a red/yellow line between them, represents where the vessels will be at CPA - closest point of approach, or when the are nearest each other, with present courses and speeds.</em><em> The meeting vessel is red, as it is a potential danger to us.</em>

            <br>
            <strong>1.</strong> If the vessel is far away it is less interesting to calculate CPA. In a busy waterway this could cut down on clutter and processing speed if a reasonable value is set. 
            <br>
            <strong>2.</strong> Similar arguments to No 1. This controls when a warning for minimum CPA distance is given. 
            <br>
            <strong>3.</strong> Similar to No 2 this controls the alarm based on a minimum time to CPA. A target is regarded as lost if regular transmissions is not received, updating the vessels status.

            <strong>Display:</strong> If and how a vessel course and speed should be displayed and stationary vessels should be on the screen. 
            <br>
            <strong>1.</strong> An arrow will be shown in front of the vessel representing it's COG (Course Over Ground). The length of this arrow and the dot at the end of it represents the calculated position in the number of minutes set here. Set easily calculated values. If a vessel approaches you doing 15 kts and the time is set to 6 minutes, the dot will be 1.5 nautical miles ahead of the vessel. 
            <br>
            <strong>2.</strong> An anchored or moored target <img alt="" src="images/ais-moor.png" align="absmiddle" height="50" width="50">&nbsp; will not be displayed if the speed is less than the value set here. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>CPA/TCPA Alerts:</strong> When an alert is triggered, a jagged circle in red is drawn around the target that set off the alarm. Additional events can be set here, drawing more attention to the alarm. For practical navigation, make sure your alarm sound is set. 
            <br>
            <strong>1.</strong> Shows an alert dialog on the screen with target information when an alarm is triggered.

             Chart Quilting 
          </h1>
           Chart quilting is a way to display parts of several charts together on the screen, redrawn to the same scale. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Quick Start</strong>
          <br>
           Hit F9 to get into quilting mode. Zooming in, automatically brings up larger scale charts, 
          <br>
           if available. Panning reveals a continuous quilt of the available charts. If you started with a raster chart, only raster-charts, and perhaps CM93, will be in the quilt. The same logic applies to S57 Vector Charts (ENCS). Make sure you are familiar with the <a href="http://opencpn.org/status_bar">status bar</a> as this will help you interpret all available information. The quilt, like a single chart can be displayed North Up or Course Up read&nbsp; <a href="http://opencpn.org/auto_follow">more here.</a>
          <br>

           What is the use of this feature?

            <br>
             Displaying charts 
          </h3>
           OpenCPN has two modes of displaying charts, single chart mode and quilting mode. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>To activate</strong><strong>chart quilting </strong>go to Toolbox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Chart Display Options and tick the box "Enable Chart Quilting",&nbsp; tick the box "Show Chart Outlines" at the same time as this will help you see which chart mode is active. 
          <br>
           Alternatively chart quilting mode can be toggled on/off with the "F9" key. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Is Chart quilting on?</strong>
          <br>
           When quilting is on, all chart outlines disappear. 
          <br>
          <br>
           When hovering with the mouse pointer over a chart button in single chart mode, a thumbnail of the chart is displayed in the upper left corner of the screen. At the same time an information box pops up above the button with details about the chart.&nbsp; This changes with quilting as the thumbnail is replaced with a high-lightning of the charts part in the quilt with a transparent reddish color. 
          <br>
          <br>
           The exception to the last rule is CM93 charts. When an area is only covered by CM93 charts, indicated by a long yellow chart button in the status bar, and in quilting mode, no info-box is displayed and no reddish highlighting is taking place.&nbsp; 
          <br>
          <br>
           More than one chart can be displayed and active at the same time, on the picture above, for example there are three pale blue buttons, as there are three raster-charts in this quilt. In single mode only one chart button is highlighted at a time. 
          <br>
          <br>
           Depth units that is normally shown in the upper right corner of the display, if activated in the toolbox, is only displayed in quilting mode if all participating charts&nbsp; uses the same unit. 
          <br>
           Zoom level, normally displayed on the far right on the Status bar, is not present in quilting. 
          <br>
          <br>
           Many of these features are illustrated in this screen-dump. 
          <br>

Notice the lack of zoom level in the status bar, a quilt , by definition, consists of several different zoom levels.</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Which charts are quilted?</strong>
          <br>
           There are several rules built into OpenCPN governing exactly how different charts reacts to the quilting mode. 
          <br>
          <strong>Raster charts</strong> and <strong>Vector charts </strong>are quilted separately and don't mix together. You can quilt either raster charts or vector charts, but not both at the same time. The exception to this rule is that CM93 ver2 charts, if available, are shown if no other chart cover exists for a displayed area, for both raster- and vector- chart quilting. 
          <br>
          <strong>CM93 ver2</strong> charts can be quilted separately. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Mercator Charts</strong> are always quilted in quilting mode 
          <br>
          <strong>Polyconic Charts</strong>, are allowed in a quilt together with Mercator charts, but a warning is issued in the chart information box, for poor georeferencing. I other words expect lower accuracy from the chart. 
          <br>
          <strong>Skewed Charts</strong> are allowed in the quilt as long as it doesn't deviate more than 5 degrees 
          <br>
           from North Up. 
          <br>
          <strong>Transverse Mercator </strong>Charts are not quilted at all, neither with other charts nor among themselves. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>User control</strong>. 
          <br>
           Users can control if an individual chart, is allowed in the quilt or not. Right clicking on any chart in a quilt and clicking "Remove this chart from quilt" on the pop up menu, removes the chart from the quilt. The chart button in the Status bar changes to <img alt="" src="images/not_participate.png" height="20" width="60">. 
          <br>
           To activate the chart again right click this button an then click "Ad this chart to quilt"

            <li>
               Click on one of the forecasts and it will be displayed. When you move the cursor over the grib display, the values for wind etc will be displayed for the cursor position, in the lower part of the "Grib Display Control". Here you can select what grib values to view. Note that not all gribfiles contains wave data.

               If you are not familiar with grib weather files, make sure you understand the basics, before you start to use them. It is essential to understand the limitations of weather forecasts in the grib format. It is also worth pointing out that gribs are <strong>not</strong> reliable near tropical systems.

Left click along the desired route you want to make. This will leave sequential waypoints as you click along.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your desired route extends off&nbsp;the currently displayed chart, move the route cursor into the desired area.&nbsp; You can zoom in and out with the&nbsp;mouse scroll wheel or keyboard&nbsp;+/- keys during route creating.&nbsp; You can&nbsp;also&nbsp;right click and select 'MAX DETAIL HERE' or 'Scale Out' during route creation. When finished right click and choose end&nbsp;route from the context menu. <img src="images/context.png" alt="" align="texttop" height="140" width="174">

             The right click menu is context sensitive, exactly what you get depend on what sort of chart it is and if quilting is activated, for example. 
            <br>
             You should now have an inacitve (Blue) route.&nbsp; Active routes are Red, inactivated routes are Blue.

             Multiple Routes&nbsp; 
          </h3>
          <p>
             OpenCPN currently&nbsp;has no provision to hide routes, so all your routes will show on the chart all the time. 
          </p>
          <p>
             &nbsp;To keep the chart clear of useful but un-needed routes follow these steps: 
            <br>
             • Create a folder called 'GPX_Routes.' 
            <br>
             • Create your route. 
            <br>
             •&nbsp;Turn on In and Out GPX icons with Tool Box-Etc-Show GPX Icons. 
            <br>
             • 'GPX OUT' with a descriptive file name and save it in a created folder called GPX_Routes. 
            <br>
             • Delete the route from the chart. 
            <br>
             • You can export all your routes as one big file or export and delete a route as you create them 
            <br>
             • When needed simply use the 'GPX IN' to open the route file.&nbsp; 
            <br>
             • These actions can also be done through the Route Manager. 
            <br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          </p>
          <p>
             To get rid of the way points left on the chart when a route has been imported and then deleted. 
          </p>
          <p>
             1. Right-click on any waypoint in the route and select 'Delete All waypoints'. 
            <br>
             2. Say 'Yes' to: 'Are you sure you want to delete &lt;ALL&gt; waypoints?' 
            <br>
             3. Right-click on the route line and select either 'Delete route' or 'Delete all routes'. 
          </p>
          <p>
             4. Answer in the affirmative. 
          </p>
          <h3>
             Marks... 
          </h3>
          <p>
             You can create a mark by right-clicking anywhere in the map, and selecting "Drop Mark Here" from the menu. The mark will have a triangle icon, to change that right-click the icon and select "Mark Properties". 
          </p>
          <p>
             You can move the mark by dragging it around. 
          </p>
          <p>
             When creating routes, openCPN will ask if it should use a nearby mark if any, when you add a routepoint. 
          </p>
          <p>
             You can delete a mark by right-clicking its icon, and selecting "Delete Mark". Deleting a mark that is part of a route, will also change the route. 
            <br>
             The <a href="http://opencpn.org/mob">Man Over Board</a> mark&nbsp; can be activated through the icon <img alt="" src="images/mob_btn.png" align="absmiddle" height="32" width="32"> in the toolbar, or through hitting Ctrl + Spacebar. The mark looks loke the button an is dropped on present position. This mark cannot be moved with the cursor (by mistake).

               Creating and Importing Great Circle Routes 
            </h3>
             GPX import can be used for many things, three sample applications follows below. First, look at this picture. Planning a trip from Cape Town to Freemantle ? 
            <br>
            <img alt="" src="images/gc.png" height="414" width="800">
            <br>
            <p>
               Here you have two imported routes, the Southern route is a pure Great Circle, the middle route is a Composite Great Circle, and then the normal Rhumb Line furthest to the north. 
              <br>
               A Great Circle is the shortest distance between two point on the globe. A composite route is the same thing with the additional condition to stay below a limiting latitude, in this case 39°30'S. A rhumb line is a straight line on a Mercator chart. The Mercator projection is the standard for OpenCPN. 
            </p>
             Let us compare the distances involved. 
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                 The pure great circle is 4610 nautical miles (M) 
              </li>
              <li>
                 The great circle as plotted with 5° of longitude between the waypoints is 4627 M 
              </li>
              <li>
                 The pure composite route, limited by latitude 39°30’ S is 4651M 
              </li>
              <li>
                 The composite route as plotted with 3° of longitude between waypoints (for the great circles) is 4669 M. 
              </li>
              <li>
                 The rhumb line is 4843 M. 
              </li>
            </ul>
             So the advantage of a great circle is obvious. The disadvantages, in this case are many. 
            <br>
             Colder weather, stronger winds, higher seas and perhaps even icebergs. The great circle is just one factor in the decision making when planning a route, the weather is likely to be the deciding factor in most cases. 
            <br>
            <br>
             A great circle route&nbsp; is created with&nbsp; the "gc" <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> script, that is cross platform. 
            <br>
             To create a gpx file containing a great circle you have to enter the departure points lat &amp; long, followed by the destination points lat &amp; long and the optionally a limiting latitude for composite sailing and the distance in long between waypoints, default is set to 5°.

            <br>
             To easy visualize all this data the "ShipWxRep" script transform a limited set of all the available data into gpx waypoints. The format, as seen above is "wind direction, wind speed, time for observation, and air pressure". This can be helpful when evaluating the accuracy of grib files, even though the best tool in this respect probably is a calibrated digital barometer.

            <br>
            <strong>Details for windows.</strong>
            <br>
             In the tab select the 'NMEA Data Source' from the choices&nbsp;shown in the drop-down box, and choose the port to which your GPS is connected. If you are using a standard serial port, then choose the proper physical port number to match. If, on the other hand, you are using a USB GPS, then you will select the virtual serial port which was created by your GPS device driver. You may need to try several selections to find the correct port. For XP/Vista: Using the Device Manager, look for a serial port which appears and disappears dynamically as you plug and unplug the USB GPS cable. This is your virtual GPS serial port. When the properly configured GPS is connected, powered up, and recognized, and a show agreen&nbsp;<img alt="" src="images/gpsGrn.png" align="absmiddle" height="28" width="28"> icon or gps status icon&nbsp;<img alt="" src="images/gps2.png" align="absmiddle" height="28" width="28"> in the right end of the tool-bar. OpenCPN automatically configures&nbsp; bits, parity, etc. These do not need to be separately specified. 
            <br>
            <strong>Details for Linux.</strong> Connect directly to one of the available physical ports, or use gpsd. For gpsd versions earlier than 2.9, select "Network GPSD" else select "Network LIBGPS". 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>GPSD Data Server:</strong> is normally "localhost", but it's possible to have one gpsd server on a local network with many OpenCPN clients. In this case, specify the network address of the gpsd server. With OpenCPN it's possible to connect even a <strong>Windows</strong> instance, to a gpsd server this way. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>NMEA Baude Rate:</strong> 4800 is the normal value for many devices, but some newer gps receivers require a different value. Check your documentation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Show GPS/NMEA data stream window:</strong> If you check this box you will get a window that shows the NMEA data sentences coming into OpenCPN. For simple NMEA data stream debugging, add the following to your opencpn.ini file:Under [Settings] add a line 
            <br>
            <em>DebugNMEA=1500</em>
            <br>
             This will provide up to 1500 debug messages pertaining to NMEA traffic to the opencpn.log

            <strong>Autopilot Output Port:</strong> Connect any NMEA 183 compatible autopilot. Select the correct serial port from the list.

          <strong>Preserve scale when switching charts:</strong>&nbsp; Normally when switching charts OpenCPN will open the new chart scaled close to it's natural scale, the zoom factor stays the same. With this box ticked OpenCPN will keep the scale from the last chart, when switching, not exactly, but generally of the same magnitude. The zoom-factor will increase as you switches to smaller scale charts.

           FAQ 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What are all those 'U' things all over my chart?</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           The feature being rendered is S57 Text relating to 'M_QUAL'. 
        </p>
        <p>
           This is a meta-object describing the quality of data shown. The Attribute of interest is CATZOC, or "Category of Zone of Confidence". The value on most US ENC's is "6", or "un-assessed". Thus, the 'U'. 
        </p>
        <p>
           You can turn this symbol off in OpenCPN by de-selecting the box next to M_QUAL in 'Tool Box' / 'Vector Charts' tab 'Mariners Standard' selection list box. 
        </p>
        <p>
           To learn the acronyms used in this application search the S57 'Object and Attribute' catalog at: <a href="http://www.s-57.com/" title="http://www.s-57.com/">http://www.s-57.com/</a>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>I have routes and way points in Sea Clear and I would like to import them into OpenCPN. Can I do it?</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           Yes. I had originally created and maintained all my routes and waypoints in SeaClear, exported them, loaded them into GPSUtility (for Windows) and saved them as text files. 
        </p>
        <p>
           To import into OpenCPN &nbsp;I opened all my text files (routes and waypoints) with GPSUtility, saved that out as one big gpx file, and loaded it into OpenCPN. Works like a champ. 
        </p>
        <p>
           I've edited them and saved them back out as GPX files with no trouble. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Individual routes can be edited and saved in appropriately named GPX files. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Whenever I try to open a particular chart OpenCPN crashes. What's going on?</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           Chances are the chart file is corrupted. Note the name and number of the suspect chart and replace it with a fresh download. 
        </p>
        <p>
           NOTE: A list of the charts with their names and file names can be found in the README.TEXT that accompanies the charts downloaded from NOOA. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Some unzip utilities for Linux are problematic when opening ECN's. If there are many corrupt charts in your download, try using a different unzip utility. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>OpenCPN and Great Circle Navigation</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           Raster charts display bearings and headings as straight, measurable lines on the chart. Similarly, Vector ENC's are rendered as Mercator projections in OpenCPN and most other ECS's for the same reason. 
        </p>
        <p>
           For typical coastal navigation, errors which occur using rhumb line instead of great circle calculations are small for the distances usually covered by one chart. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Mercator Charts and Mercator navigation is the standard for most navigational purposes. Other terms used instead of "Mercator Sailing" is "Loxodrome Sailing" or "Rhumb Line Sailing". 
        </p>
        <p>
           OpenCPN uses Mercator Sailing and cannot directly display Great Circles, but through GPX route import , Great Circle Routes can be used as explained on <a href="http://opencpn.org/planning_data">this</a> page in the wiki.
